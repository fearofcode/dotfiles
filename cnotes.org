** How to ignore individual warnings in Clang
#+BEGIN_SRC C
    #pragma clang diagnostic push
    #pragma clang diagnostic ignored "-Wdouble-promotion"
    /* this would normally produce an error with -Weverything, -Werror */

** =%a= to print floats in hex notation (C99/C11)
** C99's policy on modular arithmetic with negative values is: a % b < 0 iff a < 0; a % b == a - (a/b)*b
*** 11 / -5 == -2, 11 % - 2 == 1
*** a % b == a - (a/b)*b
*** -11 % 5 = -11 - (-11/5)*5 = -11 - (-2)*5 = -11 - (-10) = -1
