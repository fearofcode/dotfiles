some dotfiles
-------------

These files can give you a simple, text-oriented programming environment featuring:

* <a href="https://i3wm.org/">i3 window manager</a> (if on Ubuntu Linux)
* <a href="http://fishshell.com/">fish shell</a>
* <a href="https://github.com/jwilm/alacritty">Alacritty terminal</a>
* vim with a bunch of plugins added that give you autocomplete for Rust, Go and Python
* Other stuff I use at work and at home, like PostgreSQL (see scripts for details)

Here is a simple multi-monitor session showing the terminal, an editor, and a web browser on two monitors:

To get something that looks like this, run the `new_ubuntu_machine_setup.sh` script. As the name implies, it has only been tested on Ubuntu.

On a mac, run `new_mac_machine_setup.sh`. It will get you fish, Alacritty, and the vim setup.
